# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-Computer-Vision-with-TensorFlow
In computer vision, we have a convolutional neural network that is very popular for computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, image segmentation and a lot more.

Image classification is one of the most needed techniques in today’s era, it is used in various domains like healthcare, business, and a lot more, so knowing and making your own state of the art computer vision model is a must if you’re in a domain of AI.

# Convolution Neural Network
A convolutional neural network ( CNN ) is a type of neural network for working with images, This type of neural network takes input from an image and extract features from an image and provide learnable parameters to efficiently do the classification, detection and a lot more tasks.

We extract the features from the images using something called “filters”, we have different filters used to extract different features from the images.
